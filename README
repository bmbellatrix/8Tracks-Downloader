====== ABOUT =======
8Tracks (http://8tracks.com) is by far the best music site I've ever used! The site UI is brilliant, the people are superb, and the music is awesomeness
8Tracks in internet radio, so ideally you're **NOT** supposed to be able to download songs from the site! Thankfully though, it is very easy to get music from the site.

This is a simple Playlist downloader for 8Tracks.

INSTRUCTIONS:
a. Initialize your web server. I recommend WAMP for Windows and MAMP Mac OS X because they are very simple and easy to set up.
b. Copy the 8tracks-downloader folder to your web root folder.
c. Make sure that the 8tracks-downloader permissions are set to 0777.

1. Go to http://localhost/8tracks-downloader in your web browser.
2. Type in the playlist's URL and your API Key (it must be valid), and click "Analyze".
3. You can choose to download one by one (right-click on the song title and choose "Save As..") or all (click the button "Download All).
4. Relax and let it do its magic.  
5. When it has finished it'll say "Done." and your songs will be waiting in the "Downloads" folder inside "8tracks-downloader".


BRANCH UPDATE (by mundofr):
8tracks recently changed it's API policies and you are now required to authenticate with a valid API key. Changed all the requests to the new API.
I also redesigned the script flow quite a bit, a new "analysis" page shows up with the playlist description and the song list, from there you can choose to download one-by-one or download all.
The command line functionality has been completely removed.

UPDATE:
Added a UI (?). All you have to do is input playlist URL in homepage and click download! :)
Here's a peek at the simplified UI: http://brizzly.com/pic/4S3U 

UPDATE 2:
8Tracks used to provide 64K m4a (still does infact), though their primary server now encodes into 48K ...This provides smaller filesize, but less quality. So have added support for 64K encoded downloads.
Updated UI: http://brizzly.com/pic/4S4Q (Just check HIGH QUALITY to download 64K m4a's)
Maintaining 64K encoding works out pretty costly for the 8Tracks team ( http://groups.google.com/group/8tracks-public-api/browse_thread/thread/14da42858b928b88# ) so I don't know how long they'll support it for! But while they do, enjoy! :)
